# MyReads Project

First project for Udacity React course. The main purpose is to show books in their respectives shelves: _`Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read`_. Additionally we can move books between shelfs, search for books to add to a shelf, select books and send to a shelf.  
This project uses: 
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com) to view
* [PubSubjs](https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS) to facility communication between components
